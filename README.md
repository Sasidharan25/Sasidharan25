I am Sasidharan, a Dual Masters Graduate in Chemical Engineering and Technology Ventures from Carnegie Mellon University. I am particularly passionate about the infinite possibilities of using data to solve complex business problems. I am self taught in the concepts of Data Science, which I work upon through exploring and analyzing datasets in my free time. I am currently looking for full time Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles. Would love to connect with people interested in data based roles!
